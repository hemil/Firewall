# Firewall
It is a IP-Tables based Network layer firewall to control the flow of packets to and from my system. I have used all three methods, python-iptables, direct temrinal commands as well as using the NFQUEUE wrapper.
Here I have made six of the many possible configuations:
-Default: Allow only HTTP/S
-Block Incoming Pings
-Block HTTP
-Block HTTPS
-Block Destination IP
-Block all Outgoing Traffic
-Block DNS Resolution
